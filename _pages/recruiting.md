I am always interested in working with motivated students at all levels. 

I plan on hiring for <b><i>one funded Ph.D. opening starting Fall 2026</i></b>. If you are interested in developing measurement and data science skills in applied air pollution research (with a strong connection to human health impacts), and want to earn a Ph.D. in Environmental Engineering, Chemical Engineering, or Atmospheric Sciences, please get in touch!

Upcoming Ph.D. projects will focus on urban and indoor air quality, with opportunities to work in the following areas:
<ul>
	<li>Aerosol composition and air quality instrumentation (AMS-Aerosol Mass Spectrometry, aerosol size distributions, ion chromatography, inductively-coupled plasma mass spec) </li>
	<li>Mobile air pollution monitoring and spatial data analysis of urban areas</li>
	<li>Emissions source characterization</li>
</ul>
These projects will be interdisciplinary and highly collaborative with other researchers at University of Arizona and beyond.

Undergraduate students at the University of Arizona who are looking for real-world experience doing science are also highly encouraged to get in touch.
